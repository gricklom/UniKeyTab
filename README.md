# UniKeyTab

UniKeyTab is a web application helping to enter Unicode text.
It consists of a table containing text elements together with a description. By clicking on a text element it is copied to the text field at the very top. The copy-button copies the  selected elements to the clipboard. Each text element is mapped onto a base character. Entering a base character into the text field above the table filters the list.

Only text elements specified in DIN 91379 are supported.
